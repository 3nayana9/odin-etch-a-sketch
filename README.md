Etch-A-Sketch

This is a dynamic sketch pad web project — a fun and interactive Etch-A-Sketch built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s part of my learning journey into front-end development and my first step into making interactive web applications.

Project Goals

Practice DOM manipulation using JavaScript

Dynamically create and update HTML elements

Learn how to handle user input and events

Implement hover effects and toggle features

Gain confidence using CSS for layout and styling

What I Built

A 600px × 600px sketch pad where users can draw by hovering over boxes

Features include:

New Grid: Generate a new grid with user-specified squares per side

Opacity Mode: Boxes gradually darken on hover

Color Mode: Boxes display random colors on hover

Clear Button: Clear the grid

The grid adjusts the size of the boxes dynamically based on the number of squares per side

What I Learned

Manipulating the DOM with JavaScript (createElement, appendChild, innerHTML)

Handling user events (click, mouseover)

Using boolean flags to implement toggle buttons

Dynamically calculating sizes to fit a fixed container

Organizing HTML, CSS, and JS for a small interactive project

Future Improvements

Add CSS styling for a more polished UI

Make the grid responsive for different screen sizes

Add more drawing modes (e.g., gradient, eraser)

Improve performance for very large grids

Credits

This project was inspired by classic Etch-A-Sketch toys and is part of my learning in front-end web development.
